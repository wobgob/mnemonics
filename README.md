Long ago, some folks wrote a [blog post](http://mnx.io/blog/a-proper-server-naming-scheme/) about server naming schemes. One of the included recomendations was to use Oren Tirosh’s [mnemonic encoding project](https://web.archive.org/web/20090918202746/http://tothink.com/mnemonic/wordlist.html) as a wordlist.

> There are many pools of words to choose from, but the specific word list we recommend comes from Oren Tirosh’s mnemonic encoding project. These 1633 words were chosen very specifically to be short (4-7 letters), phonetically different from one another, easy to understand over the phone, and also recognizable internationally. The mnemonic word list should be much less prone to typos and transposed characters when compared to more structural names. A lot of time and research went into these words, and their properties make them ideal for our purpose.

Because of these properties we agree that these words are great for server hostnames. To generate a random mnemonic from this word list head to https://wobgob.org/mnemonic.
